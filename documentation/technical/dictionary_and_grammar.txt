Extra data in dictionary:

byte 0 & $1 : Verb flag
byte 0 & $2 : Meta flag
255 - (byte 1) : Verb number (255 - value is for "traditional Infocom reasons")



Grammar table is always located at the start of static memory (address pointed to by word at $0e in header). Word (Verb number) points to the start address for the grammar for a verb.

Byte 0: Number of grammar lines for this verb + 1
Byte 1 ... Syntax line 0, 1, ...


Grammar line

0: Highbyte of action_value
1: Lowbyte of action_value

(action_value & $0400) ~= 0 means the action is reversed

action = action_value & $03ff

3 bytes per token:
    byte 0 & $0f : token_type

If token_type = 15 (ENDIT_TOKEN), this is the end of line, and byte 1 and 2 are not supplied.

Grammar for Quit, grammar version 1:

00 params wanted
ff token 1
00 token 2
00 token 3
00 token 4

Tokens available in grammar version 1:
NOUN_TOKEN         = 0;    ! The elementary grammar tokens, and
HELD_TOKEN         = 1;    ! the numbers compiled by Inform to
MULTI_TOKEN        = 2;    ! encode them
MULTIHELD_TOKEN    = 3;
MULTIEXCEPT_TOKEN  = 4;
MULTIINSIDE_TOKEN  = 5;
CREATURE_TOKEN     = 6;
SPECIAL_TOKEN      = 7;
NUMBER_TOKEN       = 8;

ENDIT_TOKEN = $0f ! Legal, but doesn't seem to be used

Token $10-$2f are routine filters (ROUTINE_FILTER_TT).  e.g. noun=CagedCreature

Token $30-$4f are general parsing routines (GPR_TT).
Routine address is in #preactions_table-->(token-48)

Token $50-$7f are scope tokens (SCOPE_TT). e.g. scope=Spells
Routine address is in #preactions_table-->(token-80)


Token $80-$b3 are attribute filters (ATTR_FILTER_TT). e.g. edible

Token $b4-$ff are prepositions (PREPOSITION_TT). e.g. 'into'
Prepositions are located in the "adjectives table". The start address is in the constant #adjectives_table .
Each entry consists of two words. If the second word is the preposition-number (like $ff), the first
word is the address of the dictionary word. There is no length number or end marker. You should just expect
to find the entry somewhere in there.
